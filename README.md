App to transfer health data between iPhones

## WTF? What is this?
So you want to send your health data to someone? Or you got yourself a new iPhone like I did and didn't want to restore your old backup, but still sync your Health Data?
Well you can download this app onto both iPhones and sync it right over via AirDrop.

## How?
1. Clone the repo
2. Open it up in Xcode and install onto both devices
3. Open the app on the device you want to export the data from
4. Click 'Export', check all Categories that you want to export
5. AirDrop to the other phone and open in Helper
6. Allow all categories you want to save and boom.

## You made a mistake
This project was hacked together in a few hours, so please don't expect clean code of any kind. So - any pull request or other improvement is greatly appreciated.
